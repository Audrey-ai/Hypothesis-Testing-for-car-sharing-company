# Description
This project is based on an electric car-sharing service company and the aim is to conduct hypothesis testing to test a claim that there is a difference in the number of Blue cars taken from two different areas based on Postal code and we also have a complete description of the data in a separate document for easier understanding of the dataset.

Basically to best answer the research question the project phases would involve data cleaning as well as univariate and bivariate summaries.Then another thing would be to select two different populations from the data based on two areas(Postal codes 75015 and 75017) and conduct simple random sampling on these two populations to select two samples that we will use to conduct our hypothesis testing using a two sample t-test and draw appropriate conclusions from our hypothesis testing.

# Setup/Installation Requirements
All you need to run this code is a browser with access to Google CoLab or alternatively Jupyter Notebook can be used.Both tools are for data preparation and analysis. For data manipulation the Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn and scipy libraries should be imported.

The dataset used can be found on this link: http://bit.ly/DSCoreAutolibDataset
